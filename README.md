# Diabetes-Prediction
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on health-related data. The core model leverages the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification, providing a robust and interpretable approach to early diabetes detection.

How to Use:
Clone the repository and open the notebook in Google Colab.
Upload the dataset, run the cells, and input parameters to receive diabetes risk predictions.
